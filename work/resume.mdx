## 💼 **About**

I’m a **Customer Success Engineering leader** passionate about building scalable, high-performing teams that bridge the gap between **technology and outcomes**.

I thrive in **fast-paced startup environments**, where I can work hands-on with customers, design scalable processes, and empower my teams to deliver exceptional results. My approach is rooted in **technical depth, empathy, and execution**—helping both customers and internal teams succeed together.

I’m driven by:

* Building content, automations, and processes that elevate the customer experience
* Enabling customers to unlock new use cases and measurable value
* Collaborating across teams to deliver a product that customers truly love

Whether it’s scaling a success org, architecting API-driven workflows, or mentoring engineers into leaders, I find fulfillment in helping people and products grow in tandem.
