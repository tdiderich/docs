## Balance

I strive to balance my family life and work life in a way that allows me to be present in both. I believe you need to find this balance to be your best in both worlds.

## Growth

I believe you need to surround yourself with people who are going to support you as you evolve as a person. You also need to provide that same support to them as they grow.
