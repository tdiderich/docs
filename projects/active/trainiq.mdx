## 🎯 Overview

The goal of TrainIQ was to build a **personalized workout generation app** that adapts to each user’s inputs and training preferences.  
Users can define equipment, muscle groups, goals, and time available, and TrainIQ generates a complete, structured workout including **warm-up, main workout, and cool-down** sections.

Under the hood, the app uses **OpenRouter’s Mixtral and Gemini APIs** to generate structured JSON responses via Firebase Functions.  
All workouts, preferences, and credit balances are managed through **Firebase (Firestore, Auth, and Functions)**, and the front end is built in **SwiftUI** with **SwiftData** persistence and **StoreKit** for in-app purchases.
