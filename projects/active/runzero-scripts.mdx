## 🎯 Overview

runZero is a powerful asset inventory and discovery platform, but customers often need to go beyond the UI to integrate with their existing systems or automate specific workflows.  
The **runZero Scripts** repo was created as a bridge — providing practical, ready-to-use examples for:

- Automating exports and tagging  
- Integrating with third-party tools (e.g., EDR, MDM, CMDB)  
- Creating custom health and coverage reports  
- Performing complex data transformations via the API  

This hands-on approach also surfaced valuable insights and feature ideas that have directly influenced **product roadmap improvements**.
