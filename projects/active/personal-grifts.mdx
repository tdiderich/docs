## 🎯 **Overview**

**Personal Grifts** is a growing collection of experimental scripts, automations, and data tools I’ve built for fun — and often, to learn.  
Each script is designed to **automate a repetitive task, analyze data, or connect APIs** in a new way, serving as a playground for new ideas that sometimes grow into larger projects.

<Tip>
Hands-on experimentation is the fastest way to learn — and these “grifts” serve as my personal R&D lab.
</Tip>

Each project typically focuses on:
- **Data gathering or transformation** (via APIs or CSVs)  
- **Automation with GitHub Workflows** for recurring tasks  
- **AI-assisted summarization, clustering, or enrichment**  
- **Open data analysis and lightweight visualization**
