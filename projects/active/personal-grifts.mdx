# Personal Grifts

**Personal Grifts** is a growing collection of experimental scripts, automations, and data analysis tools I’ve built for fun — and often, to learn.  
Each script is designed to **automate a repetitive task, analyze data, or connect APIs** in a new way, serving as a testing ground for ideas that sometimes evolve into larger projects.

## 🎯 Overview

The repository showcases a variety of one-off or semi-automated workflows built with **Python, APIs, AI models, and GitHub Actions**.  
It reflects a hands-on approach to problem solving — from automating data collection and summarization to building lightweight pipelines that surface insights automatically.

Each script typically focuses on:
- **Data gathering or transformation** (often from APIs or CSVs)  
- **Automation via GitHub Workflows** for recurring runs  
- **AI-assisted summarization or categorization**  
- **Experimentation with open data, analytics, or language models**

## 🧩 Key Skills & Contributions

- **Python Development:** Designed modular, script-based tools for quick data analysis and API interactions.  
- **AI & Automation:** Used OpenAI and other APIs for data enrichment, clustering, and text summarization.  
- **GitHub Actions:** Automated script execution and reporting workflows using CI/CD principles.  
- **Data Analysis:** Parsed, filtered, and visualized structured and unstructured data for insight generation.  
- **Creative Experimentation:** Combined APIs and lightweight automation to explore new approaches to everyday problems.

## 🏆 Impact

- Streamlined recurring data and reporting tasks through automation.  
- Created a personal framework for testing ideas before scaling them into formal projects.  
- Provided reusable examples of **lightweight automation with zero infrastructure** (entirely GitHub-hosted).  
- Served as an ongoing playground for AI-augmented analysis and small utility development.
